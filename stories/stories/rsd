Story: Providing RSD (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Simple_Discovery)

  As a RSD-enabled client
  I want to be able to know about the available API's 
  So that I'm able to us the service without asking the user for input
  
  Scenario: Retreiving the RSD file
	Given a site with the domain avikopotato.nl
	When I go to http://avikopotato.nl
	Then I should find the RSD link tag in the header
	When I follow the href from the RSD link tag
	Then I should find the rsd xml file
